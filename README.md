# Order Form for Computer Components

This repository is created for Task 6 of the Web Application Development module as part of my studies at IU International University of Applied Sciences, Germany.

## Task Description

The task for this module was:
> Your company tasks you with developing an order form for computer components. Develop a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate how the solution might function and appear visually. Please develop the web page as a “one pager.” External links to available frameworks are allowed.

## Solution

I have completed this task by developing a web page that includes:
- An order form for selecting various computer components.
- User-friendly interface with HTML and CSS.
- Interactive elements and form validation using JavaScript.
- Responsive design to ensure usability across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For form validation and interactivity.
- **External Frameworks**: [Include any frameworks or libraries you used, such as Bootstrap.]

## Acknowledgements

I would like to extend my gratitude to our module tutor, Dr. Thomas Kopsch, for providing the guidance and opportunity to work on this project. I also want to thank IU International University of Applied Sciences for offering such a practical module in the curriculum of our Bachelor in Computer Science degree program.
